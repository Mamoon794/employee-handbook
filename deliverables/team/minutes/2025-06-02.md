## Agenda Items Discussed

### 1. User Stories Review

#### User Story 5
- Clarified distinction between:
  - Companies registering and inviting employees.
  - Employees signing up independently, regardless of whether their company is registered.
- Identified 3 user types:
  1. Public users (not registered, no company connection).
  2. Invited users (receive manual email invite from employer).
  3. Users who search for their company on the system and request to be added (lower priority feature).

#### User Story 4
- Responses should include multiple hyperlinks, even when citing the same document.
  - e.g. first endnote links to one paragraph and second endnote links to a different paragraph in the same doc.

#### User Story 10
- Owner/Admin should be able to terminate employee accounts, but only if authorized.
  - Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) via SMS (as an example) for confirmation.
- Employees can reset their own passwords, with identity verification.

#### User Story 1
- Should ask employees which province they are from.

### 2. Figma Review
- Landing page for employer (owner/admin) should feature two main buttons: Upload Documents and Invite Employees.
- Display document count for owners/admins.
- Finance users only need to see the number of users, not document uploads.

  - One paragraph with link for relevant law.
