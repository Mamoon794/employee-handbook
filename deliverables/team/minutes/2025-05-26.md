## Agenda Items Discussed

### 1. Figma Review
- Walkthrough of current Figma design and feedback.
- Chatbot name finalized as **Gail**, so need to make edits.
- Make the landing page the chat UI (remove button).

### 2. Public Users vs. Private Users
- Private users/employees can join a company via an invite link/code.
- When a user is signing up, send a code to email/phone to verify.
- Chatbot responses depend on user type:
  - Public users see content based on their location/province. We would need to retrieve this info somehow (e.g., by asking).
  - Private users (company employees) can receive a two-paragraph response:
    - First from provincial legislation (same as info provided to public users)
    - Second from company policy
  - Each paragraph includes appropriate source links.
- Employee interactions are only chat, regardless of whether they are registered with a company or not. The UI is the same for both cases.

### 3. User Types and Permissions
- Public/non-registered users and private users (employees and employers)
- We want the following info from private users:
  - First and last name
  - Email address (primary and backup)
  - Password
  - Company name
  - Billing info 
  - User type ("Employee", "Owner", "Administrator", "Finance")
- Employers have two views:
  - Standard (chat UI) view: for querying
  - Administrator view: for management by "employer" users
- Different tiers/levels of "employer" users:
  - **Owner (superuser):**  Full access, manages admins/finance personnel
  - **Administrator (HR):** Manages (add, deactivate, etc.) users, documents, passwords (e.g. reset), invoices.
  - **Finance:** Billing and invoices only
- The higher the access level, the more menu options the user would have. 
- User type stored in DB with their profile to determine privileges.
- Multiple roles may be held by one person in small companies.
- Multiple people may be assigned a single role in larger companies.
- Discuss whether we want non-registered users chat history stored. Suggested techniques: cookies, local storage.

### 4. Company Dashboard & Billing
- Dashboards for employers can vary based on user type, but can include:
  - Number of users in company
  - Usage statistics
  - Billing info and invoices
- Finance user sees financial graphs/statistics.
- Monthly billing via credit card; invoices stored and (ideally) emailed.
- Two-factor authentication for login.
- Simple password reset process needed.

### 5. Chat UI
- Include suggested/recent/popular searches:
  - Public users see general popular searches.
  - Private users see company-specific popular searches.
- Inspiration taken from ChatGPT (clean UI) and Perplexity (sourced responses).

### 6. Authentication
- Discussed using Firebase Auth, but Clerk may be better.
- User details include password changing, sign in, sign up, verification screen (send code to email/phone number)

### 7. Admin View
- Menu items: dashboard (at top), list of users (below)
- Clickable user profiles (slide-in or pop-up with details)
  - Profile includes name, picture, email, phone number, etc.
- Security settings (e.g. reset password)
- Logging system to track actions (e.g., “User signed up”, "User deactivated")

### 8. Technical & Organizational Context
- CTO is managing the core product.
- Two developers are working on the payroll engine.
- Our team is developing a standalone module (Employee Handbook App) not dependent on the core platform.
- This tool will be a separate offering and usable by users not using Rivvi’s main services.

### 9. Success Criteria & Code Ownership
- Goal: Deliver MVP and a working prototype ready for internal testing.
- Ideally, product will be nearly production-ready.
- Code ownership: Option 5 chosen
  - We may showcase the end product and describe it on resumes, but not share or distribute source code.
