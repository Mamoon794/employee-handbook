## Agenda Items Discussed

### 1. Introductions
- All attendees introduced themselves.
- Brief discussion of the motivation behind the project: employees often lack access to clear information about their rights and company-specific policies.

### 2. Problem Overview
- Employees struggle to find answers to basic questions.
- Existing platforms like SharePoint are hard to navigate.
- Googling legal questions can lead to hard-to-understand language.
- Many people feel nervous or embarrassed to ask simple questions at work, especially newcomers.

### 3. Product Vision
- Build a chatbot, similar to ChatGPT, for inquiries related to workplace policies and rights.
- Mobile-friendly webapp.
- Two main content sections:
  - **Open section**: General laws and employment rules for all users.
  - **Closed/private section**: Company-specific policies and documents for employees of a company.

### 4. Features and Capabilities
- Users can ask specific questions through a search bar (clean UI inspired by Gemini/Google).
- Can include suggested prompts to guide users.
- Users can receive answers to their questions with sources.
  - Clearly indicate whether information is from public law sources or company policy.
- Partner has a list of websites to extract data from in PDF format for public policy info.
- Backend will leverage existing LLMs (e.g., Gemini).
  - Need to determine which model is most suitable.
- Ability for a company representative to sign up, upload their handbooks/documents with corporate policies in PDF format, and invite employees to join.
- Ability for an individual to indicate their employer, which triggers a message to the company’s representative to approve access (if that company has an account).

### 5. Concerns
- Hallucinations from LLMs:
  - Mitigated by using a closed ecosystem. The model only accesses selected data, not the open internet.
- Legal considerations:
  - Focus on providing helpful info and not giving legal recommendations.
  - Will include disclaimers stating this is not legal advice.
  - If a company’s policy contradicts the law, we will not make judgments.
    - We present both pieces of information with context and let users interpret.

### 6. Tech Stack Discussion
- **Authentication**:
  - Clerk offers pre-built frontend, simple to integrate.
  - Discussed Firebase - more robust/simple.
  - Would not connect to a company's internal authentication system, though this is something that could be looked at.
- **LLM**:
  - Will explore different third-party LLMs.
- **Payment System**:
  - Plan to use Stripe for handling payments.
  - Public access would be free and companies would pay for the service.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** approach was mentioned as a potential enhancement.

### 7. Target Audience
- Perhaps initially target small companies (<20 employees) that don’t have an internal IT team or intranet.
- Tool can help businesses document their policies and provide self-service support to employees.
- Primary focus is B2C (employee empowerment), but strong B2B value proposition as well:
  - Improves employee experience.
  - Helps standardize company policy delivery.

### 8. Competitor Analysis
- No major direct competitors identified.
- Glean AI is the closest in concept. It searches across Slack, GitHub, internal docs, etc. 
  - Our chatbot would be simpler.
- Acknowledged that others may be working on similar ideas, even if not yet visible.

### 9. Timeline and Milestones
- Current focus is to align on concept and technical approach for D1.
- Follow-up meeting booked for **Monday, May 26th at 10:00 AM**.
