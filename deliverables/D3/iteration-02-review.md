# Your Team Number and Name

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. What worked well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that worked well.


 * 2 - 4 important decisions, processes, actions, or anything else that worked well for you, ordered from most to least important.
 * Give a supporting argument about what makes you think that way.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

#### Q2. What did not work well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that did not work well.

 * 2 - 4 important decisions, processes, actions, or anything else that did not work well for you, ordered from most to least important.
 * Give a supporting argument about what makes you think that way.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

1. Figma Screens Were Not Fully Finalized Before Development
- Some of the Figma designs were still being discussed or revised while we began development. As a result, certain UI decisions such as layout fixes, or page flows had to be changed mid-build based on usability concerns or new partner feedback. This made implementation less efficient, as components had to be refactored or restructured after initial work was already done.

2. Lack of initial consistent code reviews early on
- In the earlier stages, we did not have a fully consistent code review process. This led to some inconsistencies in the styling, and component reuse across different parts of the frontend code. As the codebase grew, this required additional refactoring to align components and code styles and standards. Earlier enforcement of code review guidelines could have reduced these small inconsistencies.



#### Q3(a). Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and/or how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important, with supporting argument explaining a change.

#### Q3(b). Integration & Next steps
Briefly explain how you integrated the previously developed individuals components as one product (i.e. How did you be combine the code from 3 sub-repos previously created) and if/how the assignment was helpful or not helpful.

 * Keep this very short (1-3 lines).

We prioritized core features and split them into frontend and backend tasks. To work in parallel, we selected independent tasks and assigned them based on interest and skill set during weekly team meetings. Each feature was developed in its own branch, and when branches diverged, we regularly rebased or merged main into feature branches to minimize conflicts and resolve issues early through communication.



## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features? And were there change requests?
 * What were your learnings through this process? This can be either from a process and/or product perspective.
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
