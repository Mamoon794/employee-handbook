## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What is the product?
What we will be building is essentially a chat bot which allows the users/employees to ask questions about the workplace guidelines and receive clear answers. This is to make it easier for employees and non-employees to find answers to any workplace related question that they may have. I think it should be emphasized that this should not be used as a place to get legal advice regarding workplace policies. It is more of an information booth.

#### About:
Our partner, Arshad Merali, is from a fintech company called Rivvi. It is a Toronto based company founded in 2020. Their goal is to provide tools to improve people’s financial health

#### What they want?
Our partner wants a website that will work on phone, tablets, and computers. The website will have 2 sections:
1. The first section will be for public users. Where they will have access to general public information and can get an understanding of their worker rights.
2. The second section will be for private users. These are users given access to their company’s own guidelines and policies. They will be able to ask questions privately and not have to worry about being judged.

The chatbot will provide links as it gives answers so that it can be verified where the information is coming from. It will also have the ability for a login page which differentiates the public and private users. Private users can login to see company rules and policies and ask questions to the chatbot and get clear answers with links to where the answers came from.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

## Target Users
The Employee Handbook App is built for two main user groups:
1. **Public Users**  
   These are general employees across Canada who want to understand their legal work rights. They don’t have access to internal company documents but can use the app to ask questions like “Am I entitled to paid breaks?” and get clear, chatbot-generated answers with links to legal sources.

2. **Private Users**  
   These are employees with access to their specific company’s internal policies. They log in securely to view company policies and use the chatbot to ask questions like “How do I request vacation?” and get accurate, policy-linked responses.


#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

> Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how and how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)
    * Does this application exist in another form? If so, how does your differ and provide value to the users?
    * How does this align with your partner's organization's values/mission/mandate?

#### Q4: What are the user stories that make up the Minumum Viable Product (MVP)?

 * At least 5 user stories concerning the main features of the application - note that this can broken down further
 * You must follow proper user story format (as taught in lecture) ```As a <user of the app>, I want to <do something in the app> in order to <accomplish some goal>```
 * User stories must contain acceptance criteria. Examples of user stories with different formats can be found here: https://www.justinmind.com/blog/user-story-examples/. **It is important that you provide a link to an artifact containing your user stories**.
 * If you have a partner, these must be reviewed and accepted by them. You need to include the evidence of partner approval (e.g., screenshot from email) or at least communication to the partner (e.g., email you sent)

#### Q5: Have you decided on how you will build it? Share what you know now or tell us the options you are considering.

> Short (1-2 min' read max)
 * What is the technology stack? Specify languages, frameworks, libraries, PaaS products or tools to be used or being considered. 
 * How will you deploy the application?
 * Describe the architecture - what are the high level components or patterns you will use? Diagrams are useful here. 
 * Will you be using third party applications or APIs? If so, what are they?

## Intellectual Property Confidentiality Agreement 
> Note this section is **not marked** but must be completed briefly if you have a partner. If you have any questions, please ask on Piazza.
>  
**By default, you own any work that you do as part of your coursework.** However, some partners may want you to keep the project confidential after the course is complete. As part of your first deliverable, you should discuss and agree upon an option with your partner. Examples include:
1. You can share the software and the code freely with anyone with or without a license, regardless of domain, for any use.
2. You can upload the code to GitHub or other similar publicly available domains.
3. You will only share the code under an open-source license with the partner but agree to not distribute it in any way to any other entity or individual. 
4. You will share the code under an open-source license and distribute it as you wish but only the partner can access the system deployed during the course.
5. You will only reference the work you did in your resume, interviews, etc. You agree to not share the code or software in any capacity with anyone unless your partner has agreed to it.

**Your partner cannot ask you to sign any legal agreements or documents pertaining to non-disclosure, confidentiality, IP ownership, etc.**

Briefly describe which option you have agreed to.

## Teamwork Details

#### Q6: Have you met with your team?

Do a team-building activity in-person or online. This can be playing an online game, meeting for bubble tea, lunch, or any other activity you all enjoy.
* Get to know each other on a more personal level.
* Provide a few sentences on what you did and share a picture or other evidence of your team building activity.
* Share at least three fun facts from members of you team (total not 3 for each member).

## Team-Building Activity
Yes, we met online for a team-building social activity. We spent about 1 hour and 40 minutes playing a few fun online games together, including **Codenames**, **Skribbl**, and **Gartic Phone**. All team members attended, and we had a great time bonding and getting to know each other better in a relaxed setting.
### Fun Facts from Our Team:
- We briefly debated whether frogs are consumed  
- Mamoon and Uzima like *Avatar*  
- Maya is in Greece  
- As a group, we’ve identified that arrows are very important in drawings

#### Q7: What are the roles & responsibilities on the team?

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role. 
 * Roles should reflect the structure of your team and be appropriate for your project. One person may have multiple roles.  
 * Add role(s) to your Team-[Team_Number]-[Team_Name].csv file on the main folder.
 * At least one person must be identified as the dedicated partner liaison. They need to have great organization and communication skills.
 * Everyone must contribute to code. Students who don't contribute to code enough will receive a lower mark at the end of the term.

List each team member and:
 * A description of their role(s) and responsibilities including the components they'll work on and non-software related work
 * Why did you choose them to take that role? Specify if they are interested in learning that part, experienced in it, or any other reasons. Do no make things up. This part is not graded but may be reviewed later.


#### Q8: How will you work as a team?

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have. 
 * When and where? Recurring or ad hoc? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync meeting online, etc.
 * You should have 2 meetings with your project partner (if you have one) before D1 is due. Describe them here:
   * You must keep track of meeting minutes and add them to your repo under "deliverables/minutes" folder
   * You must have a regular meeting schedule established for the rest of the term.
   * 

 

#### Q9: How will you organize your team?

List/describe the artifacts you will produce to organize your team. (We strongly recommend that you use standard collaboration tools like Linear.app, Jira, Slack, Discord, GitHub.)       

 * Artifacts can be To-Do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), meeting minutes, etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done? (You must grant your TA and partner access to systems you use to manage work)
   * **How do you prioritize tasks?**
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?
   * How do you determine the status of work from inception to completion?
  
- We may use slack/discord to facilitate communication between the group members
- We will create issues on github for new feature updates, bugs, and improvements. This way, we will be able to help each other out with any issues/blockers. 
- We can use a project management software like Jira to organize tasks and stories, or utilize docs to structure them as well. 


#### Q10: What are the rules regarding how your team works?

## Communication
### Frequency and Channels:
- The team meets twice a week:  
  Tuesdays: 7–8pm  
  Sundays: 11am–1pm  

- Meetings are held online.
- During weeks with upcoming assignments or deliverables, we may schedule additional meetings as needed.
- We will use **Discord** for real-time team communication and discussions between meetings.
- For task tracking and collaboration, we use **GitHub Issues** and **structured Google Docs** for task management.
### For partner project communication, we will:
- Assign one or more team members (likely the Product Manager, Olivia, and Scrum Master, Uzima) to serve as the main points of contact.
- Ask questions, give updates, and share meeting notes proactively.
- Hold at least 2 meetings with the partner before D1 is due (held on **Friday 10–11 am** and **Monday 10–11 am**), and then continue regular syncs as needed.
---
## Collaboration & Accountability
### Attendance and Action Items:
- Team members are expected to attend all scheduled meetings unless they have a valid conflict communicated in advance.
- All meetings will have minutes documented.
- During each meeting, we will review action items, track task progress, and flag blockers.
### Task Tracking and Status:
- We will use **GitHub Issues** to track feature development, bugs, improvements, and questions.
- Tasks will be prioritized based on **MVP goals** and **urgency**.
- The **Development Managers (Maya and Mal)** and the **Scrum Master (Uzima)** will help ensure task assignments are clear and progress is monitored.

### Assignment of Work:
Tasks are assigned based on each member’s role, strengths, and current load, with flexibility for learning and collaboration.  
For instance, AI-related tasks will primarily go to **Isa and Uzima** (AI Engineers), while back-end tasks will be picked up by **Mal, Maya, Mamoon, Uzima, and Hussain**.
### If a Team Member is Unresponsive or Not Contributing:

- First, we will reach out directly via Discord to check in and understand the issue.
- If unresponsiveness continues, the Scrum Master and Development Managers will intervene and potentially redistribute the workload.
- If the issue persists and affects deliverables, we will inform the course staff (TA/Instructor).


## Organisation Details

#### Q11. How does your team fit within the overall team organisation of the partner?
* Given the team structure of your partner, what role do you think your team will play?
* Examples include product development that includes developing new features, or quality assurance that includes developing features that test the product reliability, or software maintenance that includes fixing crucial bugs in the product.
* Provide examples of why you think you fit this role.

  

#### Q12. How does your project fit within the overall product from the partner?

Our project is the first working prototype (MVP) of an AI-powered chatbot platform that helps both public and private users access employment rights and company policies through a conversational interface. We are responsible for building the core features: a chatbot for legal and company-specific questions, public vs authenticated employee access, secure login and registration, an employer dashboard to upload policies, linked sources in chatbot responses.

Below is our mockup of the interface for the MVP.

Our team is responsible for the full development, both front and back end. Success for the partner means delivering a fully functional MVP that includes all core features necessary for real-world use. The MVP should be stable, usable across devices and ready for testing by real users. 


## Potential Risks

#### Q13. What are some potential risks to your project?
1. AI Hallucinations: One significant risk is the potential for the AI chatbot to generate inaccurate or fabricated information (hallucinations), which could mislead users or cause implementation challenges
2. Feature Ambiguity: There may be differing interpretations of key features, leading to confusion around the scope, functionality or intentions behind design. This could result in mismatched expectations between team members and the partner.
3. Imbalance prioritization of tasks or features: There’s a risk of over-focusing on certain features at the expense of others, which might lead to an uneven user experience or meeting deadlines for deliveries.
4. Lack of Employer Engagement: The success and accuracy of the private user chatbot depends on employers actively uploading and maintaining their company policies, so if they do not participate fully, employees won’t benefit from tailored responses 
5. Imbalanced workload between frontend and backend teams: There’s a possibility that the workload between front and back end may become uneven since the technical scope is still evolving and it is unclear how much effort and time each side requires, which may lead to delays or coordination issues.

#### Q14. What are some potential mitigation strategies for the risks you identified?

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### Risk: AI Chatbot Hallucinations  
**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Limit chatbot responses to only pull from trusted legal/policy sources.  
- Provide clear citations and links with every answer so users can verify the information.  
- Implement a feedback feature allowing users to flag incorrect or unclear responses.  
- Include a disclaimer stating that the chatbot is not offering legal advice.
---
### Risk: Different Interpretations of Feature Definitions or Expectations  
**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Improve clarity by writing detailed user stories and acceptance criteria.  
- Use visual mockups or flow diagrams to illustrate features before implementation.  
- Review requirements regularly in meetings and during check-ins with our project partner.
---
### Risk: Imbalanced Prioritization of Tasks or Features  
**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Align all prioritization decisions with the MVP goals and the four priorities outlined in the project brief.  
- Revisit and adjust task priorities during weekly meetings as needed.  
- Ensure that the Scrum Master and Development Managers maintain balanced workload distribution and track progress.
---

### Risk: Lack of Employer Engagement  
**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Design an onboarding flow that guides employers through uploading policies step-by-step.  
- Include reminder prompts and tooltips in the employer dashboard to encourage policy updates.  
- Build a feedback mechanism: if no company data exists, the chatbot gracefully defaults to general public law responses.
---
### Risk: Imbalanced Workload Between Frontend and Backend Teams  
**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Continuously review and refine the technical task breakdown as requirements evolve.  
- Track how much work each task will take using GitHub Issues and adjust who works on what based on that.  
- Encourage collaboration between frontend and backend developers.
